#UFOs
##Overview
-	The purpose of this website is to provide information to users on UFO sightings utilizing several criteria: date, city, country, state, and shape. 
##Results
-	While the website filters are currently being debugged, if the website were working properly it would allow the user to see both overall data on UFO sightings available and to filter according to the abovementioned criteria. For example, when entering the date “2010”, the table will filter to all of the results that are applicable to 2010.

-	The above image illustrates what the filter looks like when the date filter is working. When I attempted to add more filters to the website, errors came up and currently none of the filters are working. I hope to continue to work to debug these errors. 

##Summary
-	One drawback of this new design is that users would have to enter an exact match to get certain listings. For example, they could not enter “United States of America” and get all values pertaining to “us”. Two recommendations for further design development would be to allow for multiple values such as “United States of America” to be matched to specific entries and to create a filter for key words in the comments section.
